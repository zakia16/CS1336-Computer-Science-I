        "Remember that expressions are just values combined with operators, and they always evaluate to a single value. A **[data type](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)** is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type. The most common data types in Python are listed in Table 1-2. The values -2 and 30, for example, are said to be [integer](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex) values. The integer (or int) data type indicates values that are whole numbers. Numbers with a decimal point, such as 3.14, are called [floating-point numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex) (or floats). Note that even though the value 42 is an integer, the value 42.0 would be a floating-point number. Programmers often use number to refer to ints and floats collectively, although number itself is not a Python data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "One subtle detail about Python is that any math performed using an int and a float results in a float, not an int. While 3 + 4 evaluates to the integer 7, the expression 3 + 4.0 evaluates to the floating-point number 7.0. Any division between two integers with the / division operator results in a float as well. For example, 16 / 4 evaluates to 4.0 and not 4. Most of the time, this information doesn’t matter for your program, but knowing it will explain why your numbers may suddenly gain a decimal point."
